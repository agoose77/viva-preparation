## Nucleus Basics

- The radius of the proton is 1 fm
- Between 1 fm and 20 fm, the strengths of the strong and coulomb interactions exchange places
- 0.3% of the mass of an atom is _not_ in its nucleus
- room temperature ~eV vs nuclear reactions at ~MeV
- proton emission requires tunneling through coulomb barrier
  - what is intuition for this? 
- SEMF?
- Binding energy per nucleon is fairly constant ~8MeV/nucleon for many A, meaning that the screening effect is significant / range of internucleon force << size of nucleus
  - short range forces are nearest-neighbours in many body system
  - surface effects dominate at small sizes & B/A decreases for light nuclei
  - long-range forces not nearest neighbour (coulomb), long-range repulsion decreases B/A with A
  - 62 Ni most tightly bound
  
## Shell Structure

- Nuclear shell structure arises because of the Pauli exclusion principle, prohibiting strong scattering of nucleons inside the nucleons by preventing scatering into orbitals already occupied.
  - What is "strong scattering"?
